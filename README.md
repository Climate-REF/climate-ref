# Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF)

<!--- --8<-- [start:description] -->

**Status**: This project is in active development. We expect to be ready for beta releases in Q2 2025.

The Rapid Evaluation Framework(REF) is a set of Python packages that provide the ability to manage the execution of calculations against climate datasets.
The aim is to be able to evaluate climate data against a set of reference data in near-real time as datasets are published,
and to update any produced data and figures as new datasets become available.
This is somewhat analogous to a CI/CD pipeline for climate data.

REF is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.

## Deployments

The concept of the REF was proposed by the CMIP Model Benchmarking Task Team (MBTT),
to enable the near-realtime evaluation of CMIP7 Assessment Fast Track (AFT) datasets.
This particular deployment will feature a set of diagnostics selected by
the MBTT in consultation with the community (URL with the CMIP7 AFT configuration to come).

The individual components of the REF have been designed to be useful for
applications past the lifetime of the CMIP7 AFT.
These components can be extended to support evaluating other types of climate data.
The REF is agnostic to what types of data and metrics are to be performed.

## Installation

<!--- --8<-- [start:installation] -->

CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework can be installed with pip, mamba or conda
(mamba and conda releases are not yet implemented):


```bash
pip install climate-ref[metrics]
mamba install -c conda-forge climate-ref
conda install -c conda-forge climate-ref
```

## Getting started
<!--- --8<-- [start:getting-started] -->

### As a diagnostics provider

Diagnostic providers are the core of the REF.
They define the diagnostics that will be calculated and the data that will be used to calculate them,
by providing a consistent interface for the REF to interact with.

These diagnostic providers can be run as standalone applications or as part of the REF.
This allows them to be used in other packages or applications that may not be using the REF compute engine.

### As a modelling center

The REF is designed to enable Modelling Centers to quickly evaluate their data against a set of reference data.
The data under test here may not be published to ESGF yet,
but the REF can still be used to evaluate it.

The REF requires some reference data to be available to run the diagnostics.
Some of the reference datasets needed by the REF are available on ESGF yet.
The following command will download the reference datasets needed by the REF and store them in a local directory (`datasets/obs4ref`) as well as some sample CMIP6 datasets that we used in our test suite:

```bash
ref datasets fetch-data --registry obs4ref --output-dir datasets/obs4ref
ref datasets fetch-data --registry sample-data --output-dir datasets/sample-data
```

These datasets can then be ingested into the REF and the metrics solved using:

```bash
ref datasets ingest --source-type cmip6 datasets/sample-data/CMIP6/
ref datasets ingest --source-type obs4mips datasets/obs4ref
ref solve
```

Ingesting a large set of datasets (e.g. the entire CMIP6 corpus) can take a long time.
The ingest command accepts multiple directories via a glob pattern to limit the number of datasets that are ingested.
For the AFT, we are only interested in monthly datasets (and the associated ancillary files).
Note that the globs should be unquoted so that they are expanded by the shell as the cli command expects a list of directories.

```bash
ref datasets ingest --source-type cmip6 path_to_archive/CMIP6/*/*/*/*/*/*mon path_to_archive/CMIP6/*/*/*/*/*/*fx
```

The executed metrics can then be viewed using the `ref executions list-groups` and `ref executions inspect` commands.

### As a devops engineer

The REF is designed to be run as a set of services that can be deployed to any cloud provider.
Each of these services can be run as a separate docker container.
This allows for easy scaling and deployment of each of these services.

An example docker-compose file is provided in the repository for the CMIP7 AFT deployment of the REF using the [Celery][climate_ref_celery.executor.CeleryExecutor] executor.
This stack contains the following services:
* `climate-ref`: The compute engine service that orchestrates the execution of the diagnostics.
* `redis`: The message broker that manages the communication between the REF and the task queue.
* `postgres`: The database that stores the results of the diagnostics and the metadata about the datasets.
* `climate-ref-pmp`, `climate-ref-esmvaltool` and `climate-ref-ilamb`: The diagnostic providers that run the diagnostics.

One limitation of running the REF via docker is that all the containers must use the same paths to refer to datasets and the scratch space where outputs are written.
In practise this is achieved by sharing a set of mounts for all containers.

The REF docker compose stack requires some bootstrapping to be done before it can be run.
This bootstrapping migrates the database and builds the conda environments for PMP and ESMValTool.

```
bash scripts/initialise-docker.sh
```

An example docker-compose file is provided in the repository for the CMIP7 AFT deployment of the REF,
using the Celery executor and Redis as the message broker.
This can be run with:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the services and allow you to view the logs in the terminal.
This can be run in the background with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The docker-compose file also mounts the sample data directory to the `/ref/data` directory in the container.
These data can be ingested into the REF using the following commands (note that `/ref/data/CMIP6` refers to a directory inside the docker container, not on your local filesystem).

```bash
docker-compose run --rm climate-ref datasets ingest --source-type cmip6 /ref/data/CMIP6
docker-compose run --rm climate-ref datasets ingest --source-type obs4mips /ref/data/obs4ref
```

After the data has been ingested, the REF can be run using the following command.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm climate-ref solve
```

This stack and its associated data volumes can be cleaned up with the following command.

```bash
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

This is remove the database, any results that have been generated by the REF and remove any orphaned containers.
All data will be lost, so be careful with this command.
