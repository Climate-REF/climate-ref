# Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF)

<!--- --8<-- [start:description] -->

**Status**: This project is in active development. We expect to be ready for beta releases in Q2 2025.

The Rapid Evaluation Framework(REF) is a set of Python packages that provide the ability to manage the execution of calculations against climate datasets.
The aim is to be able to evaluate climate data against a set of reference data in near-real time as datasets are published,
and to update any produced data and figures as new datasets become available.
This is somewhat analogous to a CI/CD pipeline for climate data.

REF is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.

## Deployments

The concept of the REF was proposed by the CMIP Model Benchmarking Task Team (MBTT),
to enable the near-realtime evaluation of AR7 FastTrack datasets.
This particular deployment will feature a set of metrics selected by
the MBTT in consultation with the community (URL with the AR7 FastTrack configuration to come).

The individual components of the REF have been designed to be useful for
applications past the lifetime of the AR7 Fast Track.
These components can be extended to support evaluating other types of climate data.
The REF is agnostic to what types of data and metrics are to be performed.

## Installation

<!--- --8<-- [start:installation] -->

CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework can be installed with pip, mamba or conda
(mamba and conda releases are not yet implemented):


```bash
pip install cmip_ref
mamba install -c conda-forge cmip_ref
conda install -c conda-forge cmip_ref
```

## Getting started
<!--- --8<-- [start:getting-started] -->

### As a metrics provider

Metrics providers are the core of the REF.
They define the metrics that will be calculated and the data that will be used to calculate them,
by providing a consistent interface for the REF to interact with.

These metrics providers can be run as standalone applications or as part of the REF.

### As a modelling center

The REF is designed to enable Modelling Centers to quickly evaluate their data against a set of reference data.
The data under test here may not be published to ESGF yet,
but the REF can still be used to evaluate it.

For the tutorials and test suite,
we maintain a set of test data that can be used to evaluate the REF.
These datasets can be fetched using

```bash
ref datasets fetch-sample-data
```

These datasets can then be ingested into the REF and the metrics solved using:

```bash
uv run ref datasets ingest --source-type cmip6 ./tests/test-data/sample-data/CMIP6/
uv run ref datasets ingest --source-type obs4mips ./tests/test-data/sample-data/obs4MIPs/
ref solve
```

The executed metrics can then be viewed using the `ref executions list-groups` command.

### As a devops engineer

The REF can also be deployed as a standalone set of services that don't require any user interaction.
This is useful for running the REF to automatically evaluate data as it is published to ESGF.

The REF can be run as a set of docker containers, with each service running in its own container.
This allows for easy scaling and deployment of the REF.
These docker containers are not yet published, but can be built from the source code.

```
docker-compose build
```

An example docker-compose file is provided in the repository for the AR7 FastTrack deployment of the REF,
using the Celery executor and Redis as the message broker.
This can be run with:

```
docker-compose up
```
