# Rapid Evaluation Framework (REF)

<!--- --8<-- [start:description] -->

**Status**: This project is in active development

The Rapid Evaluation Framework(REF) is a set of Python packages that provide the ability to manage the execution of calculations against climate datasets.
The aim is to be able to evaluate climate data against a set of reference data in near-real time as datasets are published,
and to update any produced data and figures as new datasets become available.
This is somewhat analogous to a CI/CD pipeline for climate data.

REF is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.

## Deployments

The concept of the REF was proposed by the CMIP Model Benchmarking Task Team (MBTT),
to enable the near-realtime evaluation of CMIP7 Assessment Fast Track (AFT) datasets.
This particular deployment will feature a set of diagnostics selected by
the MBTT in consultation with the community (URL with the CMIP7 AFT configuration to come).

The individual components of the REF have been designed to be useful for
applications past the lifetime of the CMIP7 AFT.
These components can be extended to support evaluating other types of climate data.
The REF is agnostic to what types of data and metrics are to be performed.

## Installation

<!--- --8<-- [start:installation] -->

CMIP Rapid Evaluation Framework can be installed with pip,
alongside the providers selected for the Assessment Fast Track.
(mamba and conda releases are not yet implemented):

Window's doesn't support some of the packages required by the metrics providers,
so we only support MacOS and Linux.
Windows users are recommended to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
or a Linux VM if they wish to use the REF.

```bash
pip install climate-ref[aft-providers]
```

## Getting started
<!--- --8<-- [start:getting-started] -->

The REF is designed to enable Modelling Centers to quickly evaluate their data against a set of reference data.
The data under test here may not be published to ESGF yet,
but the REF can still be used to evaluate it.

The first step is after installation is to configure the REF.
The REF can be configured using a configuration file or environment variables.
See the [configuration documentation](https://climate-ref.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/) for more information.

Before we can run the REF, we need to fetch some reference datasets used by the diagnostics.
These datasets can be fetched using the REF CLI tool. See the [required datasets](https://climate-ref.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/requery_datasets/) for more information.

The next step is to ingest the local datasets into the REF.
These datasets must be CMOR-compliant, follow the CMIP6 data structure and expected attributes.
CMIP7-compliant datasets will be added once we have some example datasets to test against.
We don't validate any of the controlled vocabularies so non-published datasets and custom `source_ids` are allowed.

Ingesting a large set of datasets (e.g. the entire CMIP6 corpus) can take a long time.
The ingest command accepts multiple directories via a glob pattern to limit the number of datasets that are ingested.

For the AFT, we are only interested in monthly datasets (and the associated ancillary files).
Note that the globs should be unquoted so that they are expanded by the shell as the cli command expects a list of directories.

```bash
ref datasets ingest --source-type cmip6 path_to_archive/CMIP6/*/*/*/*/*/*mon path_to_archive/CMIP6/*/*/*/*/*/*fx --n-jobs 64
```

Finally, the REF can be run to solve for the unique executions that are required.
This will also perform these executions resulting in the output being produced.

```bash
ref solve
```

The executed metrics can then be viewed using the `ref executions list-groups` and `ref executions inspect` commands.
This will show the metrics that have been executed and the results that have been produced.

We recommend reading the docs there because the internal documentation links
don't render correctly on GitHub's viewer.
