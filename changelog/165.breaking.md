We changed the `ref` Command Line Interface to make the distinction between execution
groups and individual executions clear. A metric execution is the evaluation of
a specific metric for a specific set of input datasets. We group together all
executions for the same set of input datasets which are re-run because
the metric or the input datasets were updated or because a metric execution
failed. For showing results, it is more useful to think in terms of execution groups.
In particular, the `ref executions list` command was re-named to
`ref executions list-groups`.
