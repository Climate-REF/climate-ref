Add `ref datasets fetch-obs4ref-data` CLI command to fetch datasets that are in the process of being published to obs4MIPs and are appropriately licensed for use within the REF.
The CLI command fetches the datasets and writes them to a local directory.
These datasets can then be ingested into the REF as obs4MIPs datasets.
