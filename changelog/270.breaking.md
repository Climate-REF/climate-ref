Renamed packages to start with `climate_ref_` and removed `metrics` from the package name to avoid confusion.
This changes the root name of the PyPi packages from `cmip_ref` to `climate-ref` and will require updating your `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or other dependency management files to list `climate-ref` instead of `cmip_ref`.
