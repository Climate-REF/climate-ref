Added support for ingesting multiple directories at once.
This is useful for ingesting large datasets that are split into multiple directories or via glob patterns.
An example of this is importing the monthly and fx datasets from an archive of CMIP6 data:

```bash
ref datasets ingest --source-type cmip6 path_to_archive/CMIP6/*/*/*/*/*/*mon path_to_archive/CMIP6/*/*/*/*/*/fx
```
