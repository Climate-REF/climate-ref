Added a dataset ingestor for CMIP6 data that only uses the DRS information present in the filename. This greatly speeds up the process of ingesting a large number of files, as it does not require reading the file contents to extract the DRS information.

This method can be opted into by specifying `cmip6_parser: "drs"` in the REF configuration file. The default parser remains the `complete` parser, which reads the file contents to all the required metadata, but this will change in a future PR.
