Added test data management infrastructure for diagnostic development:

- New `ref test-cases` CLI commands (`fetch`, `list`, `run`) for managing and running diagnostic test cases.
- ESGF data fetching utilities with support for CMIP6 and obs4MIPs datasets.
- `TestDataSpecification` and `TestCase` classes for defining reproducible test scenarios.
