Added provider lifecycle hooks for offline execution setup. Providers can now implement `setup_environment()`, `fetch_data()`, and `post_setup()` methods to prepare for execution on HPC compute nodes without internet access. A new `ref providers setup` CLI command runs all provider setup hooks, fetching required reference data to the local cache before offline solving.
