Added lazy dataset ingestion with two-phase finalization. Datasets are now bootstrapped from directory structure metadata only (no file I/O), with full metadata extracted lazily at solve time after filtering narrows candidates. This dramatically reduces ingestion time for large CMIP6 archives on HPC parallel file systems.
