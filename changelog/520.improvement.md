Prepared the monorepo for splitting diagnostic provider packages into independent repositories. Extracted shared test fixtures into a `climate-ref[test]` pytest plugin, decoupled `climate-ref-core` from application-level types, and added API surface documentation, versioning strategy, provider compatibility CI, and a copier template for bootstrapping new provider repositories.
