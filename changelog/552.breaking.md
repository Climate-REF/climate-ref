Failed diagnostic executions now clear the execution group's dirty flag,
preventing automatic retry on subsequent solves.

Previously, failed executions were retried indefinitely.
Use ``ref solve --rerun-failed`` or ``ref executions flag-dirty`` to explicitly retry failed diagnostics.
The solver also now skips duplicate submissions when an execution with the same dataset hash is already in progress.
