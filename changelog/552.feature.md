Distinguished system errors (OOM, disk full, worker crash) from diagnostic logic errors when handling execution failures.
System errors leave the execution group dirty so they are automatically retried on the next solve,
while diagnostic errors clear the dirty flag to prevent retrying indefinitely with the same data.

The solver also now skips duplicate submissions when an execution is already in progress for the same dataset hash.

Added ``--rerun-failed`` and ``--no-wait`` flags to ``ref solve``, and a new ``ref executions fail-running`` command for marking stuck executions as failed.
