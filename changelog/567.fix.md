Fixed DRS re-ingestion from crashing or regressing already-finalised datasets. Previously, re-ingesting the same directory with the DRS parser would either crash with a `TypeError` due to `pd.NA` comparisons, or overwrite finalised metadata with empty values. Finalised datasets are now skipped during DRS ingestion while still adding any new files.

Reduced memory usage during dataset ingestion by releasing ORM objects from the SQLAlchemy session after each dataset commit, preventing unbounded memory growth on large archives.
