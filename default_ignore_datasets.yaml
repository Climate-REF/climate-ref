# This file is used to specify datasets that should be ignored by default.
#
# It can be used to ignore datasets that are known to have issues and keep
# diagnostics that use multiple datasets from running.
#
# The format used in this configuration file is:
# provider:
#   diagnostic:
#     source_type:
#       - facet: value
#       - other_facet: [other_value1, other_value2]
#
# The facets listed here will be used to create `climate_ref_core.constraints.IgnoreFacets`
# instances that will be prepended to the constraints of the data requirements
# of the diagnostics that the facets are listed under.
#
# If no `ignore_datasets_file` is specified in the REF configuration, this file
# will be downloaded from GitHub and used. If the local copy of this file is
# older than 6 hours, it will be updated.
