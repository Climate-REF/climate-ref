# Configuration

The REF uses a tiered configuration model,
where configuration is sourced from a hierarchy of different places.
Then configuration is loaded from a `.toml` file which overrides any default values.
Finally, some configuration can be overridden at runtime using environment variables,
which always take precedence over any other configuration values.
For all configuration options, the environment variables take precedence over the configuration file.

The default values for these environment variables are generally suitable,
but if you require updating these values we recommend the use of a `.env` file
to make the changes easier to reproduce in future.

## Configuration File Discovery

The REF will look for a configuration file in the following locations, taking the first one it finds:

* `${REF_CONFIGURATION}/ref.toml`
* `~/.config/climate_ref/ref.toml` (Linux)
*  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/climate_ref/ref.toml` (Linux)
* `~/Library/Application Support/climate_ref/ref.toml` (macOS)
* `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\climate_ref\ref.toml` (Windows)

If no configuration file is found, the REF will use the default configuration.

This directory may contain significant amounts of data,
so for HPC systems it is recommended to set the `REF_CONFIGURATION` environment variable to a directory on a scratch filesystem.

This default configuration is equivalent to the following:

```toml
log_level = "INFO"

[paths]
log = "${REF_CONFIGURATION}/log"
scratch = "${REF_CONFIGURATION}/scratch"
software = "${REF_CONFIGURATION}/software"
results = "${REF_CONFIGURATION}/results"
dimensions_cv = "${REF_INSTALLATION_DIR}/packages/climate-ref-core/src/climate_ref_core/pycmec/cv_cmip7_aft.yaml"

[db]
database_url = "sqlite:///${REF_CONFIGURATION}/db/climate_ref.db"
run_migrations = true

[executor]
executor = "climate_ref.executor.LocalExecutor"

[executor.config]

[[diagnostic_providers]]
provider = "climate_ref_esmvaltool.provider"

[diagnostic_providers.config]

[[diagnostic_providers]]
provider = "climate_ref_ilamb.provider"

[diagnostic_providers.config]

[[diagnostic_providers]]
provider = "climate_ref_pmp.provider"

[diagnostic_providers.config]
```

## Additional Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to control some aspects of the framework
outside of the configuration file.

### `REF_DATASET_CACHE_DIR`

Path where any datasets that are fetched via the `ref datasets fetch-data` command are stored.
This directory will be several GB in size,
so it is recommended to set this to a directory on a scratch filesystem
rather than a directory on your home filesystem.

This is used to cache the datasets so that they are not downloaded multiple times.
It is not recommended to ingest datasets from this directory (see `--output-dir` argument for `ref datasets fetch-data`).

This defaults to the following locations:
* `~/Library/Caches/climate_ref` (MacOS)
* `~/.cache/climate_ref` or the value of the `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/climate_ref`
  environment variable, if defined. (Linux)
* `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\climate_ref\Cache` (Windows)

### `REF_TEST_OUTPUT`

Path where the test output is stored.
This is used to store the output of the tests that are run in the test suite for later inspection.
