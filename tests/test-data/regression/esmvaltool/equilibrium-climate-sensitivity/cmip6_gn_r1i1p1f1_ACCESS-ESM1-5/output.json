Anomalies are calculated relative to a pre-industrial control simulation of the same model. The solid black line corresponds to an ordinary linear regression between N and ΔT. On the top left, R2 corresponds to the coefficient of determination of the linear regression. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is estimated as the x-intercept of the linear regression (interception of the solid and dashed black lines) divided by 2.",
