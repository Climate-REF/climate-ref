Earth System Model Evaluation Tool

A community tool for the evaluation of Earth system models.

https://esmvaltool.org

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community
diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the evaluation of Earth
System Models (ESMs) that allows for routine comparison of single or
multiple models, either against predecessor versions or against
observations.
